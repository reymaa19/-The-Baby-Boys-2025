      "The cold temperature of space",
      "Earth's magnetic field",
      "Friction from air resistance",
      "Solar radiation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "When asteroids enter Earth's atmosphere at high speed, friction with air molecules creates intense heat that vaporizes smaller asteroids!"

      "It would completely vaporize",
      "It would create many dangerous fragments",
      "Nothing would happen",
      "It would safely deflect away"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Blowing up an asteroid could create many radioactive fragments still heading toward Earth - deflection is safer than destruction!"

    "question": "How much advance warning would we need to deflect a dangerous asteroid?",
    "options": [
      "A few days",
      "A few months",
      "At least 5-10 years",
      "100 years"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "We need years or decades of advance warning to successfully deflect an asteroid. That's why early detection is so critical!"
